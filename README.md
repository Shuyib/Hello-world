# Hello-world

Hello All!

I'm Ben Mainye. I'm a microbiologist and now my next challenge is to make a masters using online resources like Coursera, Edx,datacamp, MIT open courseware to get a degree in bioinformatics and Systems Biology. I think i just wanna be a interdisplinary biologist because i really like getting knowledge from different areas, to fill holes. Later on i'll post the courses i've done. As well as how to achieve the goal i've previously mentioned. Since education is really expensive for me.

Hobbies:
